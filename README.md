Entire Body Finished 

We rediscussed our list to be finished at midterm checkpoint again at Tuesday as finishing the entire body attachment by this Thursday Oct 23, so we accomplished servo attachment and readjust our arm to attach to the servo.

Besides this, we also worked on building the skeleton of cardboard head and discussed the mechanism of ears wiggling servo.
